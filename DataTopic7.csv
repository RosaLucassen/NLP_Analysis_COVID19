This is a really good and common question. Here's why we don't: for some states we could. For others we could not. This is dependent on what the state shares.

@David_J_Bier @FT__Dan @J_Gelatt Some of it I think is the New York metro outbreak dominating the numbers. But I agree: we’re missing less commercial testing than we once were. I expected the positive rate to go down as we picked up those negative tests...
