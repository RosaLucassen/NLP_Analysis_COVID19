# Understanding the learning rate of Online Variational Bayesian Inference methods

Author: Eduardo Coronado

The following repo hosts a `dash` app, hosted on heroku https://vb-learning-rate-demo.herokuapp.com/ 

The app is related to two Towards Data Science articles covering Hierarcichal Dirichlet Processes (Bayesian nonparametric) for Topic Modeling
1. [Don't be Afraid of Topic Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-be-afraid-of-nonparametric-topic-models-d259c237a840)
2. Coming soon

The demo aims to provide a visual example on how two parameters `tau` and `kappa` affect the learning rate used in gradient ascent updates across multiple iterations
