# Bayesian Linear Mixed Effects Models in R

Repo contains materials covering how to implementing, diagnose and evaluate a linear hierarchical model using a Bayesian framework.

Bayesian models are implemented via the `brms` package which leverages `stan`. The data analyzed is simulated website bounce rate data. 

## Main Content

- **bayesian_linear_mixed_model.Rmd(/html)**: Rmarkdown file with code to implement, diagnose and evaluate a Bayesian linear mixed effects model using bounce rate data.

- **models**: Saved stan fitted models used in the Rmarkdown above to speed up knit time
